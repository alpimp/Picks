The Raptors still lack Dalano Banton, and the Bucks still lack Jae Crowder and Goran Dragic.

The Raptors are now in a heated moment, taking three games in a row and being dominant against the Timberwolves in their win over the Timberwolves last night, but the Bucks were inflamed before they were stopped by the Pacers on Thursday night.

Meanwhile, the Milwaukee Bucks are in pretty good form, winning five out of their last seven games, but they have to look to rebound after being knocked out by the Pacers 139-123 on Thursday.
