The Miami Heat and the Detroit Pistons meet at Little Caesars Arena on Sunday for NBA action.

The Heat lost to the injured Kyle Lowry in the last game, but are very happy to have him back in the lineup, whereas the Pistons have still missed out on Bojan Bogdanovic, Alec Burks, and Hamidou Diallo.

The Heat play this one with no rest until Sunday, but had played some good basketball on the night before and it seems to rebound against the Pistons, who are 0-6 at the plate in their last six games against a winning team. The Miami Heat should be big favorite, but they're inconsistent as hell, and you shouldn't expect much from them at the back. The Heat have trouble combining wins, even forking out atrocities, and are 3-8ATS when they are favorites at 7.5 or more points.
