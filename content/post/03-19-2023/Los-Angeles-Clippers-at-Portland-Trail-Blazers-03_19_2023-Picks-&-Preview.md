Los Angeles Clippers travel to the Moda Center on Sunday to face the Portland Trail Blazers.

The Clippers are going to be shorthanded once again, with Brandon Boston Jr. and Norman Powell still out, but should have Kawhi Leonard back after resting last night.

Los Angeles Clippers had a nice four-game winning streak before suddenly being stopped by the Magic in an 113-108 loss last night. The Clippers will be kicking themselves when they lose a game that is winnable, but it seems that they are bounced back with Leonard back in the court.

Meanwhile, the Portland Trail Blazers are in a real slump, having lost eight of their last 10 games in the organization and will be hoping to reverse the five-game loss after defeating the Celtics, 126-112, on Friday. Portland Trail Blazers continue to struggle, including dropping their last 5 games by average 14 points. This season, the Trail Blazers offense has largely relied on Damian Lillard and Anfernee Simons, who are in the top 10 and both in scoring.
