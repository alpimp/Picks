Orlando Magic visits Crypto.com Arena for a game against the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday.

The Magic Kingdom once again will be without Jameson Isaac and Jalen Suggs, while the Lakers are missing LeBron James, and Anthony Davis is listed as missing every day.

The Magic really struggled before they pulled off a nice victory against the Clippers on last night, but it will be difficult to replicate this effort on a zero-day rest against a Lakers team that has been playing some of their best basketball this season. If Orlando continues to have a hard time firing from the outside, they may want to start to play with more pace, because they are currently in the 16th league in possessions per game.

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Lakers have lost eight of their last eight games and will be hoping to aviod a third straight loss after falling to the Mavericks painfully with 111-110 defeat on Friday. Los Angeles Lakers are home, playing well and need to win such games to close out the playoffs. The Lakers are to be favored and could comfortably win.
