The Dallas Mavericks travel to the FedExForum to take on the Memphis Grizzlies on Saturday night. ## Injuries:

  - #### Mavericks

    - G Luka Doncic (thigh) out

    - G Kyrie Irving (foot) questionable

  - #### Grizzlies

    - C Steven Adams (knee) out

    - G Ja Morant (personal) out

## Betting trends:

  - The Mavericks are 1-4 ATS in their last five games against a team with a winning record, 1-10-1 ATS in their last 12 games playing on two days rest and 1-5 ATS in their last six games overall.
  - The Mavericks are 7-3 ATS in the last 10 meetings in Memphis and 4-0 ATS in the last four meetings overall.
  - The Grizzlies are 41-17-1 ATS in their last 59 home games and 5-2 ATS in their last seven games overall.
  - The Under is 4-1 in the last five meetings overall. 

The Mavericks are coming off a disappointing 113-106 loss to the Pelicans. The Mavericks are shorthanded for this one as Luka Doncic has been ruled out while Kyrie Irving is listed as questionable due to personal reasons. It's hard to back the Mavs without their best player and possibly their second-best player.

The Grizzlies will again be without Steven Adams, Ja Morant and Brandon Clarke, but they were god enough to blow away the Warriors in their last outing and they will be liking their chances in this matchup.
Memphis will be relying on Desmond Bane to provide a strong scoring performance in todayâ€™s game against the Dallas. The Memphis Grizzlies have issues of their own, but they're at home where they win by an average of 10.9 points, and they showed against the Warriors they're still dangerous at home. The Grizzlies are still a quality team even though they are missing so many key players.
