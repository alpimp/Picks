  - The Mavericks, on the other hand, are just 1-5 ATS in their last 6 games, including 1-2 ATS since the All-Star break.

The 76ers are shorthanded again as Dewayne Dedmon is still out and Joel Embiid is listed as day to day, while the Mavericks are still missing Davis Bertans who is out with a calf injury. The 76ers have been rock-sold all season and they were able to make light work of the Heat last night despite the absence of Embiid who is questionable for this one. The Mavericks are getting better on the offensive end, but theyâ€™re still struggling on the defensive end and I think that will be the difference in this one. The 76ers are 5-2 ATS in their last seven road games and I think they get the win and cover in this spot.
