## Betting trends:

  - The Bucks are 9-4 ATS in the last 13 meetings in Golden State.
  - The Bucks are 9-4 ATS in their last 13 games following a win, 9-0 ATS in their last nine road games and 10-4 ATS in their last 14 games overall.
  - The Warriors are 2-7 ATS in their last nine games following a loss, 37-16-1 ATS in their last 54 home games and 36-14-1 ATS in their last 51 home games against a team with a winning road record.
  - The Under is 28-10 in Milwaukee’s last 38 road games and 5-0 in Golden State’s last 5 contests at home.  
  - The Under is 5-2 in Golden State’s last 7 games after allowing 100 or more points in its previous contest.


The Warriors and Bucks have traded wins and losses over the last 5 meetings dating back to 2020, and Golden State will be in a revenge spot after losing to Milwaukee Dec. 13. Look for the Warriors to come out extra focused Saturday.

The Milwaukee Bucks have been on fire as they’ve won 19 of their last 20 games overall and they will be aiming for a fourth straight win after sneaking past the Nets in a 118-113 win on Thursday. The Bucks could be shorthanded again as Giannis Antetokounmpo is listed as questionable, while the Warriors are still missing Andrew Wiggins and Jonathan Kuminga. For the season, Antetokounmpo is 1st in the NBA in usage rate and 5th in player efficiency. The Bucks have opened as slight road favorites in this one and there’s a chance that Giannis will show up at the last moment given the matchup.

Meanwhile, the Golden State Warriors have been in poor form as they’ve split their last 10 games and they will be hoping to arrest a three-game skid after getting blown out by the Grizzlies in a 131-110 road loss on Thursday.

The Milwaukee Bucks are the better, more trustworthy team, and it's hard to turn them down in a near pick em spot. With all that said, the Warriors are at home, and they've shown over the years they can still get up for big games like this regardless of their current form.
