## Betting trends:

  - The Thunder are 7-1 ATS in the last eight meetings overall and I think that trend continues here as the Thunder get another win.
  - The Clippers are 0-5 ATS in their last five games playing on one days rest and 4-0 ATS in their last four games against a team with a losing record.
  - The Over-Under record in these same games is 2-3, with the teams combining for an average of 212 points per game.
  - The Under is 7-2 in the last nine meetings in Los Angeles and the Thunder are 7-1 ATS in the last eight meetings overall.

The Los Angeles Clippers play host to the Oklahoma City Thunder once again at the crypto.com Arena on Thursday night.

The Thunder are coming in with the same lineup, while the Clippers are now missing Norman Powell and Paul George.

The Oklahoma City Thunder are in fine form as they've won eight of their last 10 games  and  will be on track for a third straight win after overtaking the Clippers in a 101-100  win on Tuesday. If Thunder's offence continues to produce at its current level, it will benefit from improving its external fire. The Thunder made things more interesting than they expected when they regained 5 points before halftime, being more dominant in the second half. We just saw the Oklahoma City Thunder beat the Clippers a few nights ago, and now they're on the road, where they've had extensive coverage since last season. 

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Clippers have been in pretty good form as they’ve won five of their last seven games overall but they will be looking to bounce back here after coming up painfully short to the Thunder on Tuesday. The Clippers should be in better shape at home, but they'll also be without Paul George.
