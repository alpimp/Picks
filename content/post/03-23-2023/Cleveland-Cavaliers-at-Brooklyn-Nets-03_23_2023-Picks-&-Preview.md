The Cleveland Cavaliers and Brooklyn Nets meet Thursday in NBA action at the Barclays Center.

The Cleveland Cavaliers are playing well again, and they win in the favorite role by an average of 8.7 points while shooting almost 50 percent from the field. The Cavs are coming into this game clearly as the team in better form and they will be full of confidence having already beaten the Nest on Tuesday.

The Brooklyn Nets could use a win, but they've had a while and they're losing their last 5 games by  5.8 points on average. It's always been hard to beat the same team twice in a row in their own building, but the Nets have struggled recently and could have easily lost on Tuesday by a much larger margin if not for the late competition in the fourth trimester.
