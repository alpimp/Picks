The New York Knicks and Orlando Magic meet Thursday in NBA action at the Amway Center.

The Knicks are shorthanded again as Duane Washington Jr is listed as out, while the Magic are still missing Jonathan Isaac and Jalen Suggs.

The Knicks have gone off the boil lately and they are playing this one on zero days’ rest after last night’s tough loss to the Heat, but they’ve still been covering machines recently for the most part, especially on the road.

The Orlando Magic come up short more times than not, and they’ve been a mess defensively lately. This season, the Magic offense has primarily worked through Franz Wagner and Paolo Banchero who are 1st and 2nd on the team in scoring. If the Orlando offense is going to turn things around, not only do they need to improve their outside shooting but they must do a better job protecting the ball.
