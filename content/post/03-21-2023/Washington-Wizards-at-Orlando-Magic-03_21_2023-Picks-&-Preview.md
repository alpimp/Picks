The Washington Wizards and the Orlando Magic meet in the NBA on Tuesday at the Amway Center.

Once again, the Wizards are shorthanded, with Kyle Kuzma out and the Magic missing Jonathan Isaac and Jalen Suggs.
If the Washington offense is to turn the situation around, it is necessary not only to improve the game of outer shooting, but also to better defend the ball. In defense, the Wizards will have to improve playing as they are currently ranked 16th in the nation in the number of points allowed per game. The Washington Wizards are a complete mess right now, including losing their last 5 games, by an average of 8.6, without playing any defense.

Meanwhile, the Magic come into this game as a better team and were more competitive than they once were in a narrow loss to the Lakers in their last game. If Orlando continues to struggle to block the outside shot, he may want to play at a higher rate, as he is currently tied for 17th in the league in possession per game.
