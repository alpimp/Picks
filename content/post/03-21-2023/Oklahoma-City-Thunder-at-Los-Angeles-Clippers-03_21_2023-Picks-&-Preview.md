A key aspect of the team’s offensive struggles is the fact that they not only play at a slow pace, but they struggle to score inside.

The Oklahoma City Thunder and the Los Angeles Clippers meet in the NBA's crypto.com Arena on Tuesday.

The Thunder still miss Kenrich Williams, and the Clippers miss Norman Powell.

The Thunder have played some of the best basketball of the season recently, and tonight they will be brimming with confidence after they recover from a 15 point deficit to stun the Suns. The Clippers have now won five out of their last six games after facing the weak Trail Blazers in their last outing.

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Clippers are in great shape lately having won five out of six games and are aiming for a big win after taking on the Portland Trail Blazers 117-102 on a road trip on Sunday. This season, the Clippers offense has primarily relied on the talents of Paul George and Kawhi Leonard, who are the 1st and 2nd scoring players on the team.

The Thunder need a stronger defensive effort against the Clippers, which is only 15th in the NBA in points allowed. Oklahoma City Thunder are still trying to secure playoff status and have covered machines since last season.
