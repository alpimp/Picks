San Antonio Spurs and New Orleans Pelicans collide at Smoothie King Center on Tuesday night.

The Spurs remain in need of Jeremy Sochan, Zach Collins, and Devin Vassell, and the Pelicans still lack Jose Alvarado and Zion Williamson.

The Spurs are going to need a more forceful defensive effort against the Pelicans, which is only 23rd in points allowed. If the San Antonio offense is to change the course, not only must they improve the outside shooting, but they also must do better at protecting the ball. The Spurs deliberately lose here, and now half of their roster is on the injured list.

The Pelicans were really a burden before beating the Rockets, but still have more firepower than the Spurs even with their best player out. If New Orleans continues to have difficulty sticking to their outside ball, they may want to start to play with more speed, because they are currently sitting at 15th in the league in possessions per game.

This is difficult to choose, but the Spurs are 7-1 ATS in their last eight meetings in New Orleans, and this trend looks to continue, as those pesky Spurs stick around until the very end to claim possession.
