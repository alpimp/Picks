The Sacramento Kings host the Boston Celtics at Golden 1 Center on Tuesday night.

The Celtics again lose their favor, Payton Pritchard not returning, and the Kings still lack Kevin Huerter.

The Celtics were beginning to heat up again before the Jazz played them out on Saturday, whereas the Kings have been ablaze with recent form and are a solid 6-1 ATS in their last seven games. The Boston Celtics are going to be given the benefit of the doubt because of what they've down over the course of the season.

This season, the Kings offense has mainly been conducted through the hands of De'Aaron Fox and Domantas Sabonis, both first- and second-team scorers. The Sacramento Kings have been great this season in themselves and are at their best at home, where they have an average win rate of 5 points.
