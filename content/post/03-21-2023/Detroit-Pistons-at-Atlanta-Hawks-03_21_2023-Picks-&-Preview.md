The Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks meet in NBA action on Tuesday at State Farm Arena.

The Pistons still lack Isaiah Stewart, Isaiah Livers, and Jalen Duren, and they also list as questionable RJ Hampton.

The Hawks may also be shorthanded here, as Dejounte Murray is listed as a questionable due to an injury which is non-covidal.

The Hawks will look to continue their speed and basket-crushing rhythm throughout the game because they are at the top of the league in the field with two-points made per game.

If the Detroit offense is to change the situation, it must not only improve his outside shooting, but also protect the ball better.
