A key aspect of the team’s offensive struggles is the fact that they not only play at a slow pace, but they struggle to score inside.

Cleveland Cavaliers and Brooklyn Nets square off at Barclays Center on Tuesday night in NBA action.

The Cavaliers will again be shorthanded, as Jarrett Allen is questionable for this game, while the Nets have again ruled out Ben Simmons and list Dorian Finney-Smith as questionable.

The Cavaliers enter this meeting with a lot of momentum and will be fully rested, having not played since Friday, when they beat the Wizards by a score of 5 points.

Brooklyn Nets continue to display hiccups, making it difficult to beat quality teams.

It’s hard to give up the Cavaliers here because they are just more consistent.
