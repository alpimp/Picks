The Celtics are a little shorthanded here as Payton Pritchard and Robert Williams are both out, while the Hawks don’t have a single player listed on the injury report. The Celtics saw a drop in overall scoring when playing the Hawks, averaging 100.75 points per game.  This season, the Celtics offense has primarily worked through Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown who are 1st and 2nd on the team in scoring.

Like the Celtics, the Hawks scored at a rate below their season average, finishing with 102.75 points per game vs Boston. The Hawks are as healthy as they’ve been all year, and they’re playing improved ball. The Hawks were able to take down the Warriors in their last outing, but the Boston Celtics have the rest advantage, and they’re far and away the more consistent team
