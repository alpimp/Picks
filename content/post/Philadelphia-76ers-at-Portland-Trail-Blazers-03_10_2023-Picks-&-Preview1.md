The Portland Trail Blazers invade the Wells Fargo Center to take on the Philadelphia 76ers on Friday night. 

The 76ers beat the Blazers 105-95 on Jan. 19 with Philly covering as a 2-point road favorite while the Under 235 hit. This has been the only matchup between the two teams this season. Philadelphia is going for yet another win, as they previously defeated the Timberwolves at home. The 76ers are looking to add to their current 3 game winning streak. 

Portland could be shorthanded again as Anfernee Simons is considered questionable, while the 76ers don’t have a single player listed on the injury report. The Portland Trail Blazers are in terrible form right now as the injuries are piling up, and they’re losing their last 5 games by an average of 8.4 points. However, they were able to build some momentum with a couple of wins on the trot before they got smoked by the Celtics in their last outing. It’s hard to get behind the Trail Blazers here.
