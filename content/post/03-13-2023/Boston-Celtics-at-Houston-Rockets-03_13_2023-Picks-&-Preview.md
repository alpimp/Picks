The Boston Celtics and the Houston Rockets duke it out at the Toyota Center on Monday night


The Celtics are shorthanded again as Payton Pritchard and Robert Williams are both still out, while the Rockets are keeping an eye on Alperen Sengun who is listed as day to day.


The Boston Celtics have been in decent shape as they’ve won six of their last 10 games overall and they will be aiming for a third straight win after beating the Hawks in a 134-125 road win on Saturday. The Celtics are starting to heat up again, they’re just about at full health and they are 5-2 ATS in the last seven meetings in Houston and 6-0 ATS in the last six meetings overall.

Meanwhile, the Houston Rockets have lost 14 of their last 16 games overall and they will be hoping to snap a three-game skid after falling short to the Bulls in a 119-111 loss on Saturday. This season, the Rockets offense has primarily worked through Jalen Green and Alperen Sengün who are 1st and 2nd on the team in scoring. The Rockets have been playing a little better lately, but they’re still in full tank mode, so I’ll back the Celtics to win big on the road in this one.
