The Phoenix Suns and the Golden State Warriors duke it out at the Chase Center on Monday night.

The Suns are shorthanded once again as Landry Shamet and Kevin Durant are still out, while the Warriors are still missing Andrew Wiggins and they have Jonathan Kuminga listed as questionable.

The Suns come into this meeting as the team in better form, but they might still be nursing their wounds after losing to the Kings red-hot Kings in a 128-119 loss on Saturday in a close game. The Phoenix Suns have been in great form as they’ve won seven of their last 10 games overall and they will be hoping to bounce back here after having their four-game win streak halted by the Saturday loss.

The Warriors have yet to fully hit their stride, but they’ve looked so much more dangerous with Curry back in the lineup and they would’ve taken so much confidence from their gritty overtime win over the Bucks in their last outing. Meanwhile, the Golden State Warriors have been in pretty good shape as they’ve won six of their last nine games overall and they will be eager to stay hot after taking down the Bucks in a 125-116 overtime win on Saturday.
