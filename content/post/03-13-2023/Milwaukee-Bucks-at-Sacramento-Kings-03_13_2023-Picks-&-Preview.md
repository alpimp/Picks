The Milwaukee Bucks pay a visit to the Sacramento Kings at the Golden 1 Center on Monday night

The Bucks should have Wesley Mathews back in the lineup, but they are still sweating on the availability of Giannis Antetokounmpo who is questionable here, while the Kings don’t have a single player listed on the injury report.

The Milwaukee Bucks have been in red-hot form as they’ve won 19 of their last 21 games overall, but they will be hoping to bounce back in this one after getting stopped in their tracks by the Warriors in a 125-116 overtime road loss on Saturday. The Bucks are still the hottest team in the league despite their overtime loss on Saturday, but these Kings are a young and fearless team who would love to take advantage of the Bucks who could be missing their best player again. If the Milwaukee offense is going to continue to produce at a high level, they will need to do a better job taking care of the ball as they are turning the ball over at an above-average rate.

Meanwhile, the Sacramento Kings have been on fire as they’ve won eight of their last nine games overall and they will be gunning for a fourth straight victory after taking down the Suns in a 128-119 road win on Saturday. If the Sacramento offense is going to continue to produce at a high level, they will need to do a better job taking care of the ball as they are turning the ball over at an above-average rate.
