The Minnesota Timberwolves and Atlanta Hawks meet Monday in NBA action at the State Farm Arena.

The Timberwolves are shorthanded again as Jalen Nowell is out and Austin Rives and Rudy Gobert are both questionable, while the Hawks are keeping an eye on Bogdan Bogdanovic who is listed as questionable for this one. The Atlanta Hawks are healthy and continue to play their best ball at the moment, and this is a game they should win at home if they’re serious about playoff seeding and making a run. The Timberwolves have been below their best lately, they could be missing some players and they are only 0-5 ATS in the last five meetings overall, With that being said, the Hawks have been struggling as well, but they are almost at full health and I think they can take care of business at home in this spot.
