A matchup that should have been Morant vs. Doncic now had neither player and Irving might miss the game, too. The Grizzlies are 6-7 without Morant in the lineup, but have won 2 in a row. The Mavericks are 3-8 without Doncic in the lineup.<!--more-->

The Memphis Grizzlies and Dallas Mavericks meet Monday in NBA action at the American Airlines Center

The Grizzlies will be full of confidence after taking down the Mavericks on Saturday. And the Mavericks will be looking to snap a 2 game losing streak

The Grizzlies are going to be shorthanded again as Steven Adams, Ja Morant and Brandon Clarke are all out, while the Mavericks have ruled out Luka Doncic and they have Kyrie Irving listed as questionable. Without Ja Morant, Memphis will need Desmond Bane to step up and put together a strong scoring performance against the Dallas today.
