The Indiana Pacers and Detroit Pistons meet Monday in NBA action at the Little Caesars Arena.

The Pacers are going to be shorthanded again as Myles Turner, Tyrese Haliburton and Bennedict Mathurin are all out, while the Pistons are still without Isaiah Stewart, Hamidou Diallo and Marvin Bagley.

The Pacers are coming in as the team in better form which isn’t surprising given how poor the Pistons have been lately, but the Pacers are going to be severely depleted which makes this one a bit trickier. Against the Pistons, the Pacers will need a stronger defensive effort as they are ranked just 26th in points allowed. However, the Pacers actually have a positive scoring margin in these games at +3 points per game.

The Detroit Pistons have been in tank mode much of the season, and they lose at home by an average of 5.9 points. Personel figures to be a big issue for the Pistons in today’s game, as both Bojan Bogdanovic and Jaden Ivey are listed as out on the injury report. Smart bettors will be paying close attention to the injury report for this game.
