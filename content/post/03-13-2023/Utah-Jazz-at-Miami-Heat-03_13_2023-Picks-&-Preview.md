The Jazz are still missing Collin Sexton who is out and Jordan Clarkson is listed as questionable, while the Heat are keeping eyes on Kyle Lowry and Caleb Martin who are both questionable.

Similar to the Jazz, the Heat scored at a rate near the league average. If Miami continues to struggle with their outside shot, they may look to start playing with more pace, as they are currently 29th in the league in possessions per game. The Heat have been inconsistent all year, they take two steps back for every step they take forward, and they win by an average of 1.3 points as favorites.
