The Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Clippers meet Wednesday in NBA action at the crypto.com Arena.

The Warriors are shorthanded once again as Andrew Wiggins is still out, while the Clippers are still missing Norman Powell for this one.

The Golden State Warriors have been in great form as they’ve won seven of their last 10 games overall and they will be aiming for a third straight win after routing the Suns in a 123-112 home win on Monday. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Clippers look to have moved on from their five-game slide as they are now gunning for a fourth straight victory after routing the Knicks in a 106-95 win on Saturday.

The Warriors are coming into this meeting with plenty of momentum as they just beat the Bucks and the Suns in consecutive games, while the Clippers were able to take down the in-form Knicks in a solid win on Saturday. The Golden State Warriors in the underdog role is appealing given that they're somewhat healthy, but they're also terrible on the road, and that includes losing by an average of 7.3 points.

The Los Angeles Clippers have shown signs of getting their act together, and you'd think they'd be up for this game to kind of make a statement.
