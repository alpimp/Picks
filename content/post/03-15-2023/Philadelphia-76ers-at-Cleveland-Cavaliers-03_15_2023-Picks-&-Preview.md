It feels like Cleveland deliberately rested G Donovan Mitchell on Tuesday to play on Wednesday. However, it may be worth waiting for the Cavs’ injury report to be released because if Mitchell and C Jarrett Allen are ruled out again then I’d lean toward the 76ers.<!--more-->

The Philadelphia 76ers pay a visit to the Cleveland Cavaliers at the Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse on Wednesday night.

The 76ers are shorthanded here as Jalen McDaniels is out, while the Cavaliers are keeping eyes on Donovan Mitchell and Jarrett Allen who are both listed as day to day here. Despite both squads playing at a slow pace, they both are top 9 in offensive rating this season. You can make an argument for either side here as both teams are in winning form, but the 76ers have the advantage of extra rest as they haven’t played since Sunday, while the Cavaliers are playing their second game of a back to back set.
