## Betting trends:
  - Dallas is just 1-14 ATS this season as a 5-7-point favorite and 13-20 ATS on the road. The Mavericks are also 1-7 ATS in their last 8 road games against a team with a losing home record and 0-4 ATS in its last 4 road games against a team with a winning percentage below .400.
  - The Mavericks are 1-7 ATS in their last eight road games against a team with a losing home record, 5-21-1 ATS in their last 27 games against a team with a losing record and 1-4 ATS in their last five games overall
  - The Spurs are 1-7 ATS in their last eight games playing on zero days rest, 2-6 ATS in their last eight home games and 7-19 ATS in their last 26 games overall
  - San Antonio is 3-2 ATS in its last 5 home games and 17-16 ATS at home (compared to just 11-22 ATS on the road).
  - The Under is 3-0-1 in the Mavericks’ last 4 games overall and  3-0 in their last 3 road games. Dallas also ranks 29th of 30 teams in pace which inevitably prohibits them from scoring as many points. 
  - For the Spurs, the Under is 4-0 in their last 4 Wednesday games.
  - The Over is 4-0 in the last four meetings overall.

The Dallas Mavericks invade the AT&T Center to do battle with the San Antonio Spurs on Wednesday night.

The Mavericks are shorthanded again as Luka Doncic is still out while Kyrie Irving and Christian Wood are both questionable for this one. The Spurs are a major injury cloud hanging over the roster again as Romeo Langford, Tre Jones and Keldon Johnson are all day to day.

The Dallas Mavericks have been in a slump as they’ve lost nine of their last 12 games overall and they will be hoping to snap a three-game slide after getting thrashed by the Grizzlies in a 104-88 loss on Monday. The Mavericks could really do with a win to get their season back on track, but they could be severely depleted again.

Meanwhile, the San Antonio Spurs have been in decent shape as they’ve won four of their last seven games overall and they will be eager to stay hot after routing the Magic in a 132-114 home win last night. With Irving possibly coming back for this game and San Antonio sporting a 17-50 overall record, Dallas (-220) is justifiably a heavy favorite. However, you shouldn’t risk more than 2 times your potential return, so the moneyline is not worth a play in this one.
