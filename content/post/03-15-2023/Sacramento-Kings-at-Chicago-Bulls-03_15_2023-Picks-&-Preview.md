The Sacramento Kings and Chicago Bulls meet Wednesday in NBA action at the United Center.

The Kings are still shorthanded as Richaun Holmes has been ruled out with an illness, while the Bulls are still missing Lonzo Ball and Javonte Green.

The Bulls entered today’s game having picked up 2 straight wins. The Chicago Bulls are getting the benefit of the doubt here because they’re at home, and it’s more of a must win for them, but they’re also inconsistent.

The Kings were one of the hottest teams in the league before they ran into a rampant Bucks team on Monday, so it’s not surprise that they’ve opened as favorites in this one. Against the Bulls, the Kings will need a stronger defensive effort as they are ranked just 29th in points allowed.
