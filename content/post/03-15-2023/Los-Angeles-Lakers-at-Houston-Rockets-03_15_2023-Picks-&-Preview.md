The Los Angeles Lakers and Houston Rockets meet Wednesday in NBA action at the Toyota Center.

The Lakers are shorthanded once again as LeBron James and Anthony Davis are both out, while the Rockets are keeping an eye on Alperen Sengun who is questionable for this one.

If Houston continues to struggle with their outside shot, they may look to start playing with more pace, as they are currently 18th in the league in possessions per game. 
If the Los Angeles offense is going to turn things around, not only do they need to improve their outside shooting but they must do a better job protecting the ball. The Lakers are clearly the team in better form in this matchup and they certainly have more to play for, but they have decided to rest Davis which is dangerous against any opponent. They are winning and need to keep winning to sneak into the playoffs.
