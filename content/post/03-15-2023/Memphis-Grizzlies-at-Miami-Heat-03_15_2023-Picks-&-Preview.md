The Memphis Grizzlies and Miami Heat meet Wednesday in NBA action at the Miami-Dade Arena.

The Grizzlies are shorthanded once again as Ja Morant, Steven Adams and Brandon Clarke are all out again, while the Heat are keeping an eye on Kyle Lowry who is questionable for this one.

If Miami continues to struggle with their outside shot, they may look to start playing with more pace, as they are currently 29th in the league in possessions per game. With that said, the Heat has been a club that takes one step forward and two steps back all year.

The Miami Heat are at home, they need the win more in terms of seeding, and the Grizzlies have been a mess on the road for the last month or so. The Grizzlies have managed to keep winning games despite missing some key players, but it’s going to be tough to keep it going against this Heat team who have been on the rise lately.
