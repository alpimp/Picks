## Injuries:

  - #### Suns

    - C Deandre Ayton (hip) out

    - F Kevin Durant (ankle) out

  - #### Kings

    - G Kevin Huerter (knee) questionable

## Betting trends:

  - The Suns are 5-0 ATS in their last five road games, 5-2 ATS in their last seven games following a loss of more than 10 points and 0-6 ATS in their last six games overall.
  - The Kings are 4-1 ATS in their last five games against a team with a winning record, 1-4 ATS in their last five games following a double-digit loss at home and 7-2 ATS in their last nine games overall.
  - The Kings are 7-2 ATS in their last nine games overall and I think that trend continues here as the Kings bounce back with a win and cover at home.

The Phoenix Suns travel to the Golden 1 Center to take on the Sacramento Kings on Friday night.


 The Suns have been mired in their worst crisis of the season and it's the players who don't support Booker that have been the hot-buttoners lately. Phoenix have really fallen as they have lost 5 of their last 6 games  and they will be hoping to skate twice after being beaten 122-111 by the Lakers  on Wednesday. If Phoenix continue to struggle with outside shots, they can start playing at a higher pace, as they are currently 20th in the league in possession per game.  

 Meanwhile, the Sacramento Kings are in fine form as they have won six of their last nine games, but they will be hoping to avoid a third straight loss after being overtaken by the Celtics  132-109  on Wednesday. Father. The Sacramento Kings have been in their best form at home and are winning as the favorites with an average of 6.2 points. The Kings have cooled down a bit with a few losses at a trot, but they're stoked towards those losses.
