## Betting trends:

  - The Bucks are 11-1 ATS in their last 12 road games, 13-3 ATS in their last 16 games against a team with a losing record and 1-4 ATS in their last five games following a win of more than 10 points.
  - The Jazz are 1-4-1 ATS in their last six home games, 5-0-2 ATS in their last seven games against a team with a winning record and 6-1 ATS in their last seven games overall.
  - The Under is 8-3 in the last 11 meetings in Utah, the Bucks are 4-17 ATS in the last 21 meetings in Utah and the Bucks are 10-30 ATS in the last 40 meetings overall.

The Utah Jazz play host to the Milwaukee Bucks at the Vivint Arena on Friday night.

The Bucks are shorthanded for this one as Khris Middleton, Goran Dragic and Jae Crowder are all out, while the Jazz have ruled out Jordan Clarkson, Collin Sexton, Rudy Gay and Lauri Markkanen.

The Milwaukee Bucks have been in superb shape as they've won seven of their past nine games  and they will be looking for a third straight win after beating the  Spurs  130-94  on Wednesday. 
 Meanwhile, the Utah Jazz have been in decent form as they've won four of their past six games, but they will be looking to bounce back  after Wednesday's 127-115 loss to the Trail Blazers. 
 
 Both teams are missing some players, but given the number of key players the Jazz are missing, there's no doubt  the Bucks have a huge depth advantage.
