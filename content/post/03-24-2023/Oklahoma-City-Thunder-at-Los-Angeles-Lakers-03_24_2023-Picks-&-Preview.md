The Oklahoma City Thunder and the Los Angeles Lakers collide at the Crypto.com Arena on Friday night.

The Thunder come into this game with a lot of motivation, but they will play without a day off after being eliminated by the Clippers last night. Oklahoma City seems like a candidate for some setbacks in attack because not only are they a below-average outside firing unit but they are also generating free throws at below-average speeds. NBA average. The Oklahoma City Thunder have also included machines on the road since last season, and like the Lakers, they are battling for playoff kicks and higher seeding.  

 Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Lakers are in pretty good form as they have  won six of their last nine games  and  will be looking for a third win in a row after beating the Suns  122-111  on Wednesday. The Los Angeles Lakers should have been given home preference and had the remaining advantage, but that's a lot of points for a Lakers team facing a lot of tight games. Without LeBron James, Los Angeles will need Anthony Davis to step up and put on a solid performance against  Oklahoma City today. 

 It's going to be tight and it's tempting to take down the Thunder, but the Lakers have played some of their best basketball games this season and they  can get the job done after a big Davis game  here.
