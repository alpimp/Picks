The Houston Rockets and Memphis Grizzlies meet Friday in NBA action at the FedExForum.

The Rockets are shorthanded again as Jae’Sean Tate is still out, while the Grizzlies are still missing Steven Adams and Ziaire Williams.

These teams played each other on Wednesday and while the Memphis Grizzlies won, neither team played defense and the Rockets hung around until the end.

The Rockets have been one of the coldest teams in the league, but they were good enough to get the cover against the Grizzlies on Wednesday and I think they can do it again with the line set at double digits. The Rockets don’t win games, but they’ve been more competitive lately and are losing their last 5 games by an average of 4.4 points.

Against the Rockets, the Grizzlies are looking to add to their current 4 game winning streak. Similar to the Rockets, the Grizzlies scored at a rate near the league average, holding the edge in average point differential at +8 points per game.
