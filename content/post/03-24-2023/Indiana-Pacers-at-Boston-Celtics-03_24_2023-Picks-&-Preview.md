The Indiana Pacers and Boston Celtics meet Friday in NBA action at the TD Garden.

The Pacers can be shorthanded once more as Chris Duarte and Tyrese Haliburton are each questionable, even as the Celtics have indexed Payton Pritchard as out once more.

The Celtics have persisted to run via groups and that they would`ve taken lots of self assurance from their dominant win over the red-warm Kings. Boston need to be massive favourite for apparent reasons, mainly at home, however that is a huge number.

The Pacers have been desirable sufficient to take down the Raptors of their final day out with out their pleasant player, so they'll be trying to purpose some other upset, mainly if Haliburton can go back to the lineup. Indiana squad won't be gambling well, however they`re nonetheless combating for a gap withinside the play-in tournament, and that they lose as underdogs via way of means of a median of 3.6 points.
