The Philadelphia 76ers pay a visit to the Golden State Warriors at the Chase Center on Friday night.

The 76ers could be shorthanded for this one as Joel Embiid, James Harden and Jalen McDaniels are all listed as questionable, while the Warriors have ruled out Ty Jerome and Andrew Wiggins once again.

The Philadelphia 76ers were head and shoulders the greater constant team, and getting them withinside the underdog position is attractive. Philadelphia were in exceptional form as they`ve gained 9 in their ultimate 10 video games usual and they may be keen to live warm after making mild paintings of the Bulls in a 116-ninety one street win on Wednesday.

The damage cloud striking over the 76ers genuinely makes this one difficult to pick, however assuming that the 76ers are lacking as a minimum Embiid or Harden, it`s affordable returned the Warriors to get the win and cowl at domestic in a near one.
