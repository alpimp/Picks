In their previous game, the Magic were favored to win vs the Jazz. 

So far this season, the Heat have a record of 2-0 vs the Magic. The Heat are shorthanded once again as Kyle Lowry is still out, while the Magic will again be without Jonathan Isaac. This season, the Heat offense has primarily worked through Bam Adebayo and Jimmy Butler who are 1st and 2nd on the team in scoring. The Heat have been well below their standards for a majority of the season, but they’re starting to heat up again and they looked good in last night’s gritty comeback win over the Cavaliers.

Against the Heat, the Magic are looking to break out of a 3 game losing streak. The Magic have surprised a few teams this season, but they’ve gone off the boil lately and they might struggle if they allow the Heat to get off to a quick start.

However, the Heat are the better team and if they’re serious about staying out of the play-in game, they need to take advantage of spots like this. If the Orlando offense is going to turn things around, not only do they need to improve their outside shooting but they must do a better job protecting the ball
