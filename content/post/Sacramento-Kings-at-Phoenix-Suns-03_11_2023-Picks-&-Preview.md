Both teams are red-hot right now, with Sacramento having won 7 of their last 8 and Phoenix winning 7 of 9. They are 8-2 in the 10 games since Booker’s return.

The Kings don’t have a single player listed on the injury report, while the Suns will again be missing Kevin Durant and Landry Shamet. Against the Suns, the Kings will need a stronger defensive effort as they are ranked just 29th in points allowed. The Kings have quietly been one of the hottest teams in the league and they will be full of confidence after beating the Knicks behind a triple-double from Sabonis.

Phoenix will be relying on Devin Booker to provide a strong scoring performance in today’s game against the Sacramento. The Suns have been in fine form themselves and they should be well-rested after making light work of the Thunder in a big win on Wednesday  The Phoenix Suns are going to get the benefit of the doubt because they're at home, but Durant is down again, and they're going up against a good Kings team that continues to win and cover numbers.
