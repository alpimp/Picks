The Washington Wizards and Philadelphia 76ers meet Sunday in NBA action at the Wells Fargo Center.

This season, the 76ers offense has primarily worked through Joel Embiid and James Harden who are 1st and 2nd on the team in scoring, while the Wizards offense has worked through Kristaps Porzingis and Kyle Kuzma. 

Against the 76ers, the Wizards will need a stronger defensive effort as they are ranked just 16th in points allowed. While the Wizards don’t win a lot, they’re a competitive squad that actually wins on the road by an average of 0.1 points and loses as underdogs by an average of 2.2 points. If Washington continues to struggle with their outside shot, they may look to start playing with more pace, as they are currently 21st in the league in possessions per game.
