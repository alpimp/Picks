yThe Cleveland Cavaliers and Charlotte Hornets meet Sunday in NBA action at the Spectrum Center.

The Cavaliers could be shorthanded in this one as Jarrett Allen and Darius Garland are both listed as questionable, while the Hornets are still missing LaMelo Ball and Mark Williams. The Cavaliers come into this meeting as the team in better form and they really shouldn’t have too much trouble getting past this Hornets team who have so little to play for at this stage of the season.
