The Portland Trail Blazers have been in poor form as they’ve lost five of their last seven games overall and they will be hoping to avoid a third straight defeat after falling painfully short to the 76ers in a heartbreaking 120-119 road loss on Friday.<!--more-->

The New Orleans Pelicans play host to the Portland Trail Blazers at the Smoothie King Center on Sunday night

The Trail Blazers are still shorthanded as Ryan Arcidiacono and Justise Winslow are still out, while the Pelicans are still missing Jose Alvarado, Zion Williamson and Brandon Ingram. The Trail Blazers have really been in a funk lately and their confidence took a real hit after they wasted a 21-point lead against the 76ers on Friday, but something tells me that Lillard is going to have a big game against his former teammate, McCollum.

If the New Orleans offense is going to turn things around, not only do they need to improve their outside shooting but they must do a better job protecting the ball
On defense, the Pelicans will look for some improved play, as they are currently the 13th ranked unit in points allowed per game
