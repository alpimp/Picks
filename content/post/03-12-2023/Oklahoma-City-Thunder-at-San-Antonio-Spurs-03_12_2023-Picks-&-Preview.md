The Oklahoma City Thunder pay a visit to the San Antonio Spurs at the AT&T Center on Sunday night.


The Spurs could be shorthanded for this one Keldon Johnson and Jeremy Sochan are both questionable, while the Thunder are coming into this one with the same lineup that beat the Pelicans last night.


The Oklahoma City Thunder are starting to heat up again as they’ve won four of their last five games and they will be looking to stay hot after routing the Pelicans in a 110-96 road win last night. This season, the Thunder offense has primarily worked through Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Josh Giddey who are 1st and 2nd on the team in scoring.

The Spurs have sprung to life with three good wins in their last five outings, but they could be missing two of their best players and they’ve been anything but consistent this season. If the Spurs are going to turn things around on offense, they must improve their overall shooting efficiency.
