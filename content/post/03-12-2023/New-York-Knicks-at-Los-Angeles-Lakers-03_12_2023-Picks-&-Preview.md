The New York Knicks and Los Angeles Lakers meet Sunday in NBA action at the crypto.com Arena.

Los Angeles will be counting Anthony Davis to put together a strong scoring performance vs the New York, as LeBron James has been ruled out for today’s game. The Knicks could be shorthanded once again as Duane Washington Jr and Jalen Brunson are both questionable. The level of competition has been tight in the 5 most recent games between Knicks and Lakers with just 1 points per game separating the teams.

The Knicks have really gone off the boil with three losses on the trot and now they have to play their second game of a back to back set against the Lakers who are playing their best basketball of the season. Right now, the Knicks offense is in search of answers, as not only do they tend to play at a slow pace, but they are just 22nd in effective field goal percentage

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Lakers have been in red-hot form as they’ve won seven of their last nine games overall and they will be gunning for a fourth straight victory after beating the Raptors in a 122-112 home win on Friday. The Los Angeles Lakers are playing their best ball of the season right now, and they need to keep winning to sneak into the playoffs.
