The Bulls showed again that they can upset any team on their day, but it’s always hard to beat the same team twice in a row.

The Philadelphia 76ers and the Chicago Bulls meet in basketball action at United Center on Wednesday.

The 76ers may be shorthanded with this one, as James Harden and PJ Tucker are listed as questionable, whereas the Bulls keep an eye on Alex Caruso, who is also listed as questionable.

The 76ers enjoyed a streak of eight wins before they hit the Bulls on Monday night, so they would love revenge in this location.

The Bulls have played some good ball lately, including winning their last 5 games with an average score of 6.2 points and needing to continue their winning ways to secure a place in the Play-In tournament.
