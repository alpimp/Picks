Golden State Warriors and Dallas Mavericks meet at American Airlines Center on Wednesday for NBA action.

The Warriors again lack Andrew Wiggins, Ty Jerome, and Andre Iguodala, whereas the Mavericks are watching Markieff Morris, Kyrie Irving, and Luka Doncic, all of whom are questionable.

With Luka Doncic out, Dallas scored a shockingly low 12 points in the fourth quarter. Dallas is coming off a disappointing loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, in which the Mavs lost a 16-point lead that they established late in the third quarter. One thing that works in their favour is the absurd road record of the Warriors.

Itâ€™s hard to stand in the way of the Dallas Mavericks, with either Luka or Kyrie out or questionable, but the Warriors must prove that they can do the job.
