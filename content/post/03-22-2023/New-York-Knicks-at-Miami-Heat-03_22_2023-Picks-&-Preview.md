Two of the best defensive teams in the league collide in this game, so it's time for a close, low-scoring affair with the Knicks coming out on top in the end.

The New York Knicks and Miami Heat meet at the Miami-Dade Arena on Wednesday for NBA action.

The Heat have been in a pretty good shape lately, but could again be shorthanded as Kyle Lowry is listed as questionable.

The Miami Heat are better offensively, but still a club that steps back when they step forward. If Miami continues to lose its ability to make the outside shots, they may want to begin playing at a higher rate, as they are currently at 29th in the league in possessions per game.

The Knicks played some of their best basketball last season before they slid into the Timberwolves on their last outing, but are still playing as underdogs despite being in near-full health.
