The Phoenix Suns and the Los Angeles Lakers meet at crypto.com Arena on Wednesday night for NBA action.

The Suns are again shorthanded, with Kevin Durant and Deandre Ayton out, and the Lakers still lack LeBron James.

The Phoenix Suns are in a bit of a rut, having lost four of their last five games, and are hoping to bounce back after falling to the Thunder with 124-120 on their final road game. The Phoenix Suns are the better team on paper, but they've recently been in a funk, including losing their last five games by average of 6.6 points.

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Lakers are in good shape, having won five out of their last eight games, and will look to maintain momentum after defeating the Magic with 111-105 victory on Sunday. The Los Angeles Lakers have played the best ball in the last couple weeks and show more urgency. The Lakers simply need to win games if they're going to clinch a playoff spot or even get into the play-in tournament.
