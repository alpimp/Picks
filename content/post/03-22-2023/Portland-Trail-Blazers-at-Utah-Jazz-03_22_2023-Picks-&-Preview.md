The line has shifted a ton into the Jazz direction, and probably for good reason.

The Portland Trail Blazers and Utah Jazz collide in Vivint Arena on Wednesday night.

Trail Blazers again come short with Jerami Grant and Anfernee Simons out, while Jazz drafted Jordan Clarkson and Lauri Markkanen is listed as questionable.

The Portland Trail Blazers have been in awful shape, losing nine out of their last 11. They hope to reverse the six-game slide following their loss to the Clippers at 117-102 on Sunday.

The Portland Trail Blazers suffer a ton of injuries and lose their last 5 games average 12.6 points. They slide in the wrong direction at the worst possible time and are almost done with their playoff hopes.

Meanwhile, the Utah Jazz are on a nice offseason, winning four out of their last five games overall, and will aim to take home a third straight victory, after defeating the Kings 128-120 on Monday. The Jazz must continue to win if they want to join a play-in tournament.

Both teams do not give the bettors much confidence at the time, but the Jazz are clearly in better shape and are also 6-0 ATS in their last six games.
