## Betting trends:

  - The Timberwolves are 1-4 ATS in their last five home games and 1-4 ATS in their last five games against a team with a losing record.
  - The over is 8-2 in the last 10 meetings overall, the Hawks are 5-1 ATS in the last six meetings overall and the Hawks are 4-0-1 ATS in the last five meetings in Minnesota.

The Atlanta Hawks head to Target Center for a matchup with the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night.

The Hawks may be shorthanded again because Dejounte Murray is reported is listed as day to day, while the Timberwolves were focusing on Jaylen Nowell, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Anthony Edwards, who are reported as questionable.

The Hawks have been trying to build a long-term win streak, but are able to keep their heads above the water and are happy with the large victory of last night. The Atlanta Hawks have played a decent ball in the last month, but are still having trouble pulling off victories.

Meanwhile, the Minnesota Timberwolves are still in a rut, losing five of their last seven games overall, but they will continue to build momentum after falling three games behind by beating the red-hot Knicks on Monday. The Minnesota Timberwolves play their best ball at home, where they win on average 1.2 points, and it is believed that Edwards and Towns will return to this contest.

There is certainly a time to review the lineups before the game, but assuming that Timberwolves come back short, weâ€™ll stick to the Hawks to do the job.
