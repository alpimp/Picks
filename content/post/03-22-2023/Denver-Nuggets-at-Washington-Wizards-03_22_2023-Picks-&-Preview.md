The Nuggets of Denver and the Wizards of Washington meet at Capital One Arena on Wednesday night for NBA action.

Nuggets still lack collin Gillespie and Wizards still lack Kyle Kuzma.

The Nuggets are currently in the worst slump of the season, but emerged from it with the much-needed win over the Nets and would like to continue the momentum with a more impressive victory over this struggling Wizards. The Nuggets aren’t the best of the best, but still play better than the Wizards, and it seems they can do the job on the road on this one.

The Washington Wizards seem to be a team running out of fuel, which includes losing their last five games by an average of 9.2 points.

A healthy Nuggets side should roll given the Wizard’s current form.
