The Indiana Pacers and the Toronto Raptors meet in the NBA Preseason Game at the Scotiabank Arena on Wednesday night.

The Pacers may be shorthanded again, because Chris Duarte and Tyrese Haliburton are questionable, while the Raptors watch Scottie Barnes, who is listed as auestionable in this one.

The Pacers have cooled off since Haliburton again and it seems they will be struggling again if he isn’t able to suit up.

The Raptors are a better team that plays better ball, and it is easy to understand why they are among the big favorites.
