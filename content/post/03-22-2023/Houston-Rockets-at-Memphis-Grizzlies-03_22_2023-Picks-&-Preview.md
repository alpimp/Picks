 The Houston Rockets and Memphis Grizzlies again collide at FedEx on Wednesday night.

The Rockets are shorthanded once again as Jae’Sean Tate is still out, while the Grizzlies are still missing Steven Adams and Dillon Brooks for this one.

The Rockets are uproariously good with five victories in their past 10 games,  but they’ve cooled off with three straight losses, and would hardly hold on to the current Grizzlies, who will have Ja Morant back in the lineup once he’s wrung out of suspension.

Meanwhile, the Memphis Grizzlies are in great form, winning six out of their last seven overall games and aiming for a fourth straight win after beating the Mavericks 112-108 on Monday. Memphis is a better team at home and there's going to be energy in the building with Morant making his return.
