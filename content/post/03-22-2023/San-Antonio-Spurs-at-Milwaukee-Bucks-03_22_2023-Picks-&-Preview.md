One can hardly imagine anything but an easy win for the Bucks in this spot, but with the line so hefty, so the Spurs can hang around long enough to get a backdoor cover in the end.

The San Antonio Spurs travel to the Fiserv Forum to battle the Milwaukee Bucks on Wednesday night

The Spurs are likely shorthanded again as Jeremy Sochan, Keldon Johnson and Devin Vassell are all listed as day to day, while the Bucks have ruled out Meyers Leonard, Jae Crowder and Goran Dragic again.

The end of the regular season cannot come quickly enough for the Spurs, who rest a different player every night, while the Bucks continue to pass teams through on the nightly basis. San Antonio Spurs are stuck as they lose six out of their last nine games and will be hoping to bounce after their 119-84 defeat to the Pelicans at home on Friday night.

Meanwhile, the Milwaukee Bucks are in great shape, winning six of their last eight overall games and looking to stay hot after beating the Raptors 118-111 home on Sunday. The Bucks are capable of blowing the doors off, but this is also late in the season for a veteran team.
