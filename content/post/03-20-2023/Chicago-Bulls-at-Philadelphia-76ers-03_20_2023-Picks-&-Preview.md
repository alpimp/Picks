The Chicago Bulls and Philadelphia 76ers meet at the Wells Fargo Center on Monday for NBA action.

The Bulls again have to compete with Alex Caruso and Javonte Green listed as questionable, and the 76ers are keeping tabs on PJ Tucker, who is currently out with a sprain of the ankle.

Philadelphia 76ers play at home best, and a blowout win would be nothing but disappointing, but the Bulls have played well over the last week, and even after losses, they are usually competitive.

The Bulls are living up to their four wins in their past five games, and they would love to continue that momentum by taking on the 76ers. If Chicago is still troubled with the outside shot, they might consider starting to play with more speed, because they are currently sitting 17th in the league in possessions per game.

However, the 76ers are currently passing teams and are 22-9ATS in their last 31 home games.
