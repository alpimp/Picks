Minnesota Timberwolves and the New York Knicks meet in NBA action at Madison Square Garden on Monday.

The Timberwolves may be shorthanded, as Naz Reid, Rudy Gobert, Austin Rivers, and Anthony Edwards are questionable, and the Knicks enter this game without one injured player.

The Timberwolves have really gone cold lately, they just got blown out by the Raptors and could be without most of their starting lineup for this one.

The Knicks have been one of the hottest teams in the league, and after taking on the Nuggets in their last outing, they will be full of confidence. The offense of the Knicks is currently searching for answers because they not only play slowly, but also rank only 22nd on the effective percentage of field goals.

The New York Knicks are covering numbers and the Timberwolves are dealing with a boatload of injuries.
