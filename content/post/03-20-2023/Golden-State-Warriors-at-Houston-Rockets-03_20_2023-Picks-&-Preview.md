The Golden State Warriors pay a visit to the Houston Rockets at the Toyota Center on Monday night.

The Warriors are shorthanded again as Andrew Wiggins is still out and Kevon Looney is listed as questionable, while the Rockets don’t have a single player listed on the injury report.

The Golden State Warriors have been in terrible shape as they’ve lost six of their last eight games overall and they will be hoping to put a halt to a three-game skid after getting thrashed by the Grizzlies in a 133-119 road loss on Saturday. The Warriors are mired in their worst slump of the season and they could easily find themselves behind big early if they decide to look past these young Rockets who have shown glimpses of their potential over the last nine games or so.

Also, while the Rockets don't win games, they've been more competitive lately, and that includes losing their last 5 games by an average of 1.8 points.
