Right now there are question marks across the board heading into this game for the Mavericks as there is a chance they will be without their two leading scorers vs the Grizzlies. Memphis will be counting Desmond Bane to put together a strong scoring performance vs the Dallas, as Ja Morant has been ruled out for today’s game.

Dallas Mavericks and Memphis Grizzlies are set to battle it out at FedExForum on Monday.

The Mavericks could be without Luka Doncic, Kyrie Irving, and Markieff Morris again, while the Grizzlies ruled out Ja Morant and Steven Adams, with Jaren Jackson Jr. listed as questionable.

Dallas Mavericks are in fine shape as they have blown out their last eight overall games and aim to win the third time after beating the Lakers 111-110 on the road on Friday. The Mavericks have made things more interesting than they expected, giving up some of their 8-point lead at halftime by showing an utter lackluster 2nd half performance.

Meanwhile, the Memphis Grizzlies deal with injuries for a while, but this hasn’t hindered them, as they now win five out of their last six games, beating the Warriors 133-119 on Saturday. The Grizzlies have demonstrated that they are better equipped to win without their best players, and we will see that again during this matchup if neither Doncic nor Irving can arrive.
