The Sacramento Kings take on the Utah Jazz at Vivint Arena on Monday night.

The Kings might be shorthanded here because Trey Lyles and Kevin Huerter are questionable, while the Jazz still lack Jordan Clarkson and Collin Sexton, with Lauri Markkanen on the short list as questionable.

Smart bettors will closely monitor the injury report for this match because the Jazz are so beleaguered that they are lacking two of their best scorers against the Kings.

Sacramento Kings are one of the hot teams in the league, having won 11 out of their last 13 overall and aiming to get the fourth straight win after vying to beat Washington Wizards 132-118 on the road on Saturday. The Kings will need a more effective defensive effort against the Jazz as they are only 29th in the allowed points.

The Utah Jazz start to heat up now that they’ve won three out of their last four games and are eager to stay hot after the Celtics beat them 118-117 at home on Saturday. The Jazz of Utah are still playing a decent ball and are worth looking into as a decent underdog.
