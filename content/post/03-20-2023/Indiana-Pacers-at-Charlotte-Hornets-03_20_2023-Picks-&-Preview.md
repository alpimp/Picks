The Indiana Pacers and the Charlotte Hornets meet at Spectrum Center on Monday to play the NBA.

The Pacers again have Tyrese Haliburton listed as out, and Chris Duarte, Bennedict Mathurin, and Isaiah Jackson are questionable.

The Hornets are in almost perfect health, with the exception of LaMelo Ball, who has been out for the remainder of the season.

The Charlotte Hornets are a mess this year and lose their last 5 games average 11.8 points. Although the Hornet's offense does well to obtain possessions, its poor shooting percentage is the key to its poor scoring performance. The Hornets will also look for improvement in defense, as they are currently the 25th unit in allowed points per game.

The Pacers were on a good run before getting stopped by the 76ers during their last outing, whereas the Hornets are failing to recover after losing Ball this season. The Indiana Pacers must profit from such games if they eager to sneak into the playoff conversations.
