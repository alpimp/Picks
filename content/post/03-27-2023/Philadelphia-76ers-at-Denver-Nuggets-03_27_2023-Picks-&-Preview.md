The Philadelphia 76ers and the Denver Nuggets duke it out at the Ball Arena on Monday night.

The 76ers could be shorthanded here as Joel Embiid and James Harden are both questionable, while the Nuggets are keeping an eye on Michael Porter Jr who is questionable for this one.

Right now there are question marks across the board heading into this game for the 76ers as there is a chance they will be without their two leading scorers vs the Nuggets.

The 76ers were on a roll before they got stopped by the Nuggets on Saturday, but in a row so I’m expecting the 76ers to bounce back if they have their full squad.
The Philadelphia 76ers have gone off the boil with three losses in their last four outings and they will be hoping for a better performance after getting scorched by the stumbling Suns in a 125-105 road loss on Saturday. Although, it’s always tough to beat the same team twice .

However, the Denver Nuggets win at home by an average of 10.8 points while shooting 52 percent from the field, and they're 24-13 ATS at home.
On defense, the Nuggets will look for some improved play, as they are currently the 14th ranked unit in points allowed per game.
