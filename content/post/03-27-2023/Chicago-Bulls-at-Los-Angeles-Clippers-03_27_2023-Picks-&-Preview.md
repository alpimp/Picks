## Injuries:

  - #### Bulls

    - G Javonte Green (knee) questionable

  - #### Clippers

    - F Kawhi Leonard (face) probable

## Betting trends:

  - The Bulls are 4-0-1 ATS in their last five road games and they are also 4-1 ATS in the last five meetings in Los Angeles, so I’ll lean towards the Bulls in this spot.
  - The Bulls are 2-6 ATS in their last eight games against a team with a winning record and 5-1 ATS in their last six games overall.
  - The Clippers are 5-1 ATS in their last six games against a team with a losing record and 4-1 ATS in their last five games following a loss of more than 10 points.
  - The Over is 5-2 in the last seven meetings overall, the Bulls are 5-2 ATS in the last seven meetings overall and the Bulls are 4-1 ATS in the last five meetings in Los Angeles.

The Bulls are keeping an eye on Javonte Green who is listed as day to day, while the Clippers are again missing Norman Powell and Paul George.

The Chicago Bulls have been in great shape as they’ve won seven of their last nine games overall and they will be aiming for a third straight victory after taking down the Lakers in a 118-108 road loss last night.

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Clippers have been in great shape as they’ve won six of their last nine games overall and they will be hoping to bounce back after getting routed by the Pelicans in a 131-110 loss on Saturday.
The Los Angeles Clippers should be favored at home with the rest advantage, but they remain a hit or miss team.
