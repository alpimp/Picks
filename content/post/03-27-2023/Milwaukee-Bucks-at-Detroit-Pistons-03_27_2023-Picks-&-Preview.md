The Milwaukee Bucks and Detroit Pistons meet Monday in NBA action at the Little Caesars Arena.

The Bucks were in red-hot form before they ran into the Nuggets in a tough loss on Saturday, while the Pistons have continued to drop games on a nightly basis as they’ve lost 16 of their last 17 games overall.

The Bucks will be kicking themselves after they played so poorly in the second half on Saturday, but they can to bounce back against this ice-cold Pistons team who just got blown out by the Raptors.
