The Dallas Mavericks and Indiana Pacers meet Monday in NBA action at the Gainbridge Fieldhouse.

The Mavericks are shorthanded here as Luka Doncic has been ruled out, while the Pacers have listed Tyrese Haliburton and Myles Turner as questionable.

Against the Pacers, the Mavericks are looking to break out of a 4 game losing streak.
The Mavericks could really do with a win to get their season back on track, but they’ve really been struggling lately and last night’s loss to the lottery-bound Hornets doesn’t do much for their confidence.

On defense, the Pacers will look for some improved play, as they are currently the 26th ranked unit in points allowed per game.
So far, the Pacers are 17th in fields goals made per contest.

Without Luka Doncic, Dallas will need Kyrie Irving to step up and put together a strong scoring performance against the Indiana today.
