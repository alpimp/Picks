The Houston Rockets and New York Knicks meet Monday in NBA action at Madison Square Garden.

The Rockets will again be missing Jae’Sean Tate, while the Knicks are keeping an eye on Jalen Brunson who is questionable for this one.

The Rockets have gone cold again with five losses on the trot and they are coming into this one fresh off a blowout loss to the Cavaliers.
If the Houston offense is going to turn things around, not only do they need to improve their outside shooting but they must do a better job protecting the ball.

The Knicks head into today’s action in the midst of a 3 game losing streak.
The Knicks have been well below their best lately, but they were close against the Magic and they should be well-rested as they haven’t played since Thursday.
