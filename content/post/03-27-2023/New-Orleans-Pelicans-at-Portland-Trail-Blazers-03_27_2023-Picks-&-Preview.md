Lot of points for a road team, but the Pels should win this comfortably.

## Betting trends:

  - The Pelicans are 8-18 ATS in their last 26 road games and 4-0 ATS in their last four games overall.
  - The Pelicans are 9-4 ATS in the last 13 meetings overall and I’m backing them to build on that trend in this spot.
  - The Trail Blazers are 1-5 ATS in their last six home games, 4-1 ATS in their last five games against a team with a losing record and 2-5 ATS in their last seven games overall.
  - The Under is 6-1 in the last seven meetings overall and the Pelicans are 9-4 ATS in the last 13 meetings overall.

The New Orleans Pelicans and the Portland Trail Blazers do battle at the Moda Center on Monday night.

The Pelicans are shorthanded again as Zion Williamson and Jose Alvarado are both out, while the Trail Blazers are still missing Jerami Grant, Anfernee Simons and they are keeping an eye on Damian Lillard who is day to day.

The New Orleans Pelicans have sprung to life with five wins in their last seven games overall and they will be eager to build on their current four-game win streak after taking apart the Clippers in a 131-110 road win on Saturday.
The New Orleans Pelicans are the healthier side, need to keep winning to position themselves better in the playoffs, and they're winning their last 5 games by an average of 16.6 points.

Meanwhile, the Portland Trail Blazers have been in a real slump as they’ve lost eight of their last nine games overall and they will be aiming for a third straight victory after taking down the Thunder in a 118-112 loss last night.
On defense, the Trail Blazers will look for some improved play, as they are currently the 27th ranked unit in points allowed per game.
The Portland Trail Blazers aren't playing well, are without many key players, and they're on the end of a back to back.


The Pelicans have been on fire lately and it’s no surprise that they’ve opened as heavy road favorites as the struggling Trail Blazers will struggle again, especially if Lillard doesn’t suit up.
