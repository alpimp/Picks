One situation to keep an eye on leading up the game is the availability of De’Aaron Fox, as he is currently questionable on the injury report

## Injuries:

  - #### Timberwolves

    - Not yet submitted

  - #### Kings

    - F De’Aaron Fox (hamstring) questionable

## Betting trends:

  - The Timberwolves are 6-2 ATS in their last eight road games, 5-1 ATS in their last six games playing on zero days rest and 15-6 ATS in their last 21 games against a team with a winning record.
  - The Kings are 5-2 ATS in their last seven games against a team with a winning record and 7-2 ATS in their last nine games overall.
  - The Over is 5-0 in the last five meetings in Sacramento, the Timberwolves are 3-1-1 ATS in the last five meetings in Sacramento and the Timberwolves are 6-2-1 ATS in the last nine meetings overall.

The Sacramento Kings play host to the Minnesota Timberwolves at the Golden 1 Center on Monday night.

The Kings could be shorthanded here as De’Aaron Fox is listed as questionable with that hamstring injury, but the Kings have been one of the form teams of the league and I don’t think they’re going to slow down in this one.

The Minnesota Timbeolves are starting to heat up again as they will be gunning for a fourth straight victory after sneaking past the Warriors in a 99-96 road win last night, which could lead to a flat performance here. Minnesota appears to be a candidate to have some offensive regression as not only are they a below average outside shooting unit, but they are generating free-throws at a rate below the NBA average.

Meanwhile, the Sacramento Kings have been in fine form as they’ve won eight of their last 11 games overall and they will be aiming for a third straight victory after outlasting the Jazz in a 121-113 home win on Saturday. The Sacramento Kings play their best ball at home, but they also win in the favorite role by an average of 6.3 points while shooting 51.1 percent from the field.
