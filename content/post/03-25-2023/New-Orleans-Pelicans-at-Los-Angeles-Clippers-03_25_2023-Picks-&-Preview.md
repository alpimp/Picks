The New Orleans Pelicans and the Los Angeles Clippers do battle at the Crpyto.com Arena on Saturday night.

The Pelicans are shorthanded again as Jose Alvarado and Zion Williamson are still out, while the Clippers are still missing Paul George and Norman Powell.

The New Orleans Pelicans have been building nicely as they’ve won four of their last six games overall and they will be aiming for a fourth straight victory after routing the Hornets in a 115-96 win on Thursday. If New Orleans continues to struggle with their outside shot, they may look to start playing with more pace, as they are currently 14th in the league in possessions per game.

The New Orleans Pelicans are playing improved ball as of late, but they still have a consistency issue and not a team I trust on the road. Against the Clippers, the Pelicans will need a stronger defensive effort as they are ranked just 13th in points allowed.

Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Clippers have been in fine form as they’ve won six of their last eight games overall and they will be hoping to stay hot after routing the Thunder in a 127-105 home win on Thursday.
The Los Angeles Clippers play their best ball at home, and they're winning their last 5 games by an average of 7.8 points.

The Pelicans are coming into this one with plenty of winning momentum, but those wins came against the lesser teams in the league, so the recent play of the Clippers deserves keeping an eye on it, especially Leonard who barely missed in Thursday’s big win over the Clippers.
