The Suns haven’t been able to build any momentum despite big games from Booker and we may see that again as the deeper 76ers get the win on the road thanks to another monster game from Embiid.

The Philadelphia 76ers and the Phoenix Suns collide at the Footprint Center on Saturday night.

The 76ers are shorthanded again as James Harden and Jalen McDaniels are both out, while the Suns are still missing Kevin Durant and DeAndre Ayton.

The Philadelphia 76ers have been in fine form as they’ve won nine of their last 11 games overall, but they will be hoping to bounce back here after coming up short against the Warriors in a 120-112 loss last night.

Meanwhile, the Phoenix Suns have been in a terrible slump as they’ve lost six of their last seven games overall and they will be hoping to put a halt to a three-game skid after getting beaten by the Kings in a 135-127 road loss last night. The Phoenix Suns may be at home, but they're in rough shape at the moment, which includes losing their last 5 games by an average of 6.4 points. Also, they lose as underdogs by an average of 5.2 points.

Both teams lost last night, but it has clearly been the 76ers who are the team in better form in this matchup.
