The Brooklyn Nets and Miami Heat meet Saturday in NBA action at the Miami-Dade Arena.

The Brooklyn Nets will again be missing Seth Curry, while the Heat are keeping eyes on Caleb Martin and Kyle Lowry who are both questionable here.

The Brooklyn Nets continue to head in the wrong direction, and that includes losing their last 5 games by an average of 6.6 points.
On defense, the Nets will look for some improved play, as they are currently the 18th ranked unit in points allowed per game.

The Miami Heat are quietly playing their best ball of the season over these last two weeks, and their offensive numbers have improved dramatically.
The Nets are struggling for form at the moment and their confidence took another hit after dropping two in a row to the Cavaliers, so the Heat looks more reliable since they have quietly been playing some of their best basketball of the season.
