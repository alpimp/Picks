The Utah Jazz and the Sacramento Kings duke it out at the Golden 1 Center on Saturday night.

The Jazz are shorthanded again as Lauri Markkanen, Jordan Clarkson and Rudy Gay are all out, while the Kings don’t have a single player listed on the injury report.

The Utah Jazz are still playing for potential playoff seeding, but they're heading in the wrong direction, and that includes getting smoked by the Bucks last night. They’re still banged up.

Meanwhile, the Sacramento Kings have been in great shape as they’ve won seven of their last 10 games overall and they will be hoping to stay hot after taking down the Suns in a 135-127 home win last night. The Sacramento Kings play their best ball at home, and they win as favorites by an average of 6.3 points.
