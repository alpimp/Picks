The Milwaukee Bucks and Denver Nuggets meet Saturday in NBA action at the Ball Arena.

The Bucks will again be shorthanded as Khris Middleton is still out, while the Nuggets are still without Collin Gillespie.

The Bucks have continued to run through teams on a nightly basis and they will be full of confidence after demolishing the in-form Jazz last night. The Milwaukee Bucks in the underdog role is always attractive, but Denver isn’t an ideal place to play on the end of a back to back.

The Nuggets look to have moved on from their slump with three wins in their last four games and they should be well-rested as they haven’t played since Wednesday. The Denver Nuggets are one of the best home teams in the league, where they win by an average of 10.4 points and shoot 51.9 percent from the field.
