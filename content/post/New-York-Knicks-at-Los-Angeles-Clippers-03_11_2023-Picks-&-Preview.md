New York will take the court having lost 2 straight games
A key injury to note in this game is the absence of the Knicks 2nd leading scorer, Jalen Brunson with a sore foot.
If the Knicks offense is going to turn things around, they will need to either generate more possessions or improve their overall efficiency.

Los Angeles comes into the game having rattled off 2 straight wins. The Clippers will again be missing Norman Powell. The Clippers have been hit or miss all year, and you’re never sure which side is going to show up game to game.

The Knicks have cooled off from their hot run of form, but they were more than competitive in a narrow loss to the surging Kings on Thursday. The New York Knicks are playing some of their best ball in recent memory, and they’ve been covering machines on the road.
